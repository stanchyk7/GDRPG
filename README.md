# GDRPG

A framework for Godot based on RPG Maker made to streamline making grid-based games, such as top-down RPGs.

## Be advised: GDRPG is still in beta! You can support its development by committing to it, whether by adding new features or extending/polishing existing ones.

## Features

- grid-based movement
- selective game and entity state saving
- main menu and pause menu, you can also add  extra menus if you'd like (one at a time)
- scene switcher with transitions (fade in/out, dissolve in/out based on heightmap - the kind you see in RPG Maker)
- character movement routes, consisting of custom extendable Movement resources, which can be modified on the fly
- interface for displaying additional pictures during dialogue (and moving them, rotating them, resizing them etc.)
- camera which follows a target and can lerp to its position
- infinite tilemap layers
- everything else Godot offers on top of that

## TODO

- audio systems
- doors and other specialized game elements
- polish, polish, polish
- make an actual game with it!
